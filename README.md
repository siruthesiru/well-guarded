# Well Guarded: A Tower Defense Game

An army of slimes are attempting to contaminate your town’s well: your only
source for fresh water and it is your job to protect it from them at all costs. You do this by
constructing offensive towers of different varieties to attack said slimes before they reach the well.

<br>

Each level can be edited through the editing of ‘.stage’ files found in the game’s data folder.
New levels can also be added simply by adding a new ‘.stage’ file to the folder. Each file contains
the settings for how many slimes will spawn in that stage, their speed, as well as the well’s health.
